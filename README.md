An iPhone app to accelerate the editing of podcasts.

one of a few big buttons to log that position in the
track with a note for later editing/review.


The features:

1. Back 45 button - steps back 45 seconds
1. Play/Pause
1. Send - emails a message with the notes
1. Annotations (the big buttons): Edit, Link, Other
